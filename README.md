# Hi, I'm Chaebeom Sheen 

👋 Hi, I am a medical 🩺 student attending Seoul National University of Medicine. My main background is in *medicine* and *physics*.

🧬 I'm mainly interested in **Bioinformatics**, and **Computational Neuroscience**. I'm currently learning Bioinformatics at [ChangLabSNU](https://github.com/ChangLabSNU) and studying Computaional Neuroscience with SNUCN, which has members such as [Younghoon Kim](https://github.com/aktivhoon). I'm also working with [`@lemonardo`](https://github.com/Future-medicine-Kor) for digitizing medicine. 

I'm interested in any application of medicine or biochemistry that takes a *quantitative* and *dynamic* approach to components of the human body.
Long term, I believe that taking this more mathematical approach to the body can help solve the following questions:

- intelligent drugs and diagnostic devices by DNA computing or Generative Neural Networks
- combining both *physical* and *chemical* modalities for targeted ablation
- artificial neuron prosthesis to reverse neurodegenerative diseases
