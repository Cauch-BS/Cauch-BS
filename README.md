# Hi, I'm Chaebeom Sheen 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a medical ðŸ©º student attending Seoul National University of Medicine. My main background is in *medicine* and *physics*.

ðŸ§¬ I'm mainly interested in **Bioinformatics**, and **Computational Neuroscience**. I'm currently learning *Bioinformatics* at [ChangLabSNU](https://github.com/ChangLabSNU) and working with [`@lemonardo`](https://github.com/Future-medicine-Kor) for digitizing medicine. 

In the long term, I'm interested in any application of medicine that takes a *quantitative* and *dynamic* approach to components of the human body. Separate molecules and components of the body that were previously intractable due to their computational intractably have now become approachable to modern researchs through the power of compute. 
Long term, I believe that taking this more mathematical approach to the body can help solve the following questions

- intelligent drugs and diagnostic devices by DNA computing or Generative Neural Networks
  - For more on DNA Computation see [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0699-0) which leverages DNA computation for diagnostics
  - Also interesting might be [this team](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00502-7) which implemented convolutional neural networks using DNA
- targeted ablation of pathologic tissues by combining both *physical* and *chemical* modalities, such as demonsrated through BNCT or theranostics
- and much more
